## Notes ##
- To generate WSDL and OWL-S for a service, refer [OWL-S-Steps](https://github.com/inmind-project/semantic-middleware/tree/ankit-progress/owlspace/OWL-S-Steps).
- The ontologies hosted on http://dangiankit.ddns.net/~dangiankit are provided in the [./ontologies](ontologies) dir. If the ddns host is down, copy the ontologies to a local instance of a web server, and update its location in owl-s's MatchMaker and update all occurrences in respective OWL and OWL-S files.
